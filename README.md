Hi my name is Lars, 
i am a webdeveloper located in Schweinfurt/Germany.
Currently i got 2.5 years of working experience in a web-agency.

In my daylie work i am dealing with php, html5, css3 and js while working with Craft3 CMS, typo3 and shopware (sometimes).

At the moment i am looking for a job in webdevelopment to take the next step. Besides the former mentioned CMS i am thinking about leaving the world of php-based frameworks
to enter the wide world of js-frameworks (especially React).

This repository will be used to show some of my works, my private projects and some little projects i started to learn how to code with.

So feel free to check out my repository...
